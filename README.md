FlexGrid is Customized WPF DataGrid that has convenient and useful features.
When developed using WPF, Microsoft-supported DataGrid has limited functionality. (Nested & Merged ColumnHeader, Variable Column, etc.)

So, I need DataGrid with the features I needed and I develop the FlexGrid and shared in GitHub.
