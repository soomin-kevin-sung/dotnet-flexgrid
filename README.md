FlexGrid is a custom WPF DataGrid with convenient and useful features. When developing code using WPF, the Microsoft-supported DataGrid has limited functionality, such as nested and merged column headers and variable columns. However, with FlexGrid, your DataGrid development environment becomes significantly more convenient!

I'm proud to say that FlexGrid was fully built by me, and I'm excited to share it on GitHub :)
